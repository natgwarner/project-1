##Compact Application Tracker

Hi! I'm the Compact Application Tracker, or CAT for short. I'm a linux cli that can ssh into other machines and perform a variety of functions:
    - Display currently running programs using ps and log them to a text file
    - View and remove logs I created on the target machine
    - View the target machine's filesystem
    - View the target machine's ip configurations

To run me, clone me onto your machine, enter the proper directory, and type "go run main.go" into the console. I'll guide you from there.
